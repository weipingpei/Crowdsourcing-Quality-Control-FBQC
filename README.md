# Crowdsourcing-Quality-Control-FBQC
Fine-grained Behavior-based Quality Control (FBQC) is a framework that extracts fine-grained behavioral features on the crowdsourcing platform.
We implemented this JavaScript library that can be easily used by job requesters to obtain fine-grained behavioral features from different types of task webpages.
This code is for the CSCW2021 paper "Quality Control in Crowdsourcing based on Fine-Grained Behavioral Features".
Please refer to our full paper for more details.


## Introduction
- `FBQC.js`: The JavaScript library used for tracking fine-grained behavioral features.
- `example_cml.html`: Different type of helper tags used to create different type of tasks on the Figure Eight crowdsourcing platform of Appen.

## Usage
- Replace "your_tracking_server_url" in the JavaScript library (`FBQC.js`) with the url of your server that used to store collected features.
- Include our JavaScript library in the “Javascript” field to the design webpage on the Figure Eight crowdsourcing platform of Appen.
